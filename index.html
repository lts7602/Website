        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have been studying computer science at the University of Tulsa, but I wanted to learn more on my own as well. This summer I decided to spend some time learning JavaScript and corresponding CSS techniques to broaden my experience with languages. I have previous experience in Java, Python, and some limited experience in C. 
        My dream job is to work as a software engineer. I loved my software engineering class as it really expanded my perspective on the lifetime and upkeep of real world software projects.</p>


        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My goal with this webpage is to create a website using different Javascript and CSS principles that I am learning on my own. I originally started with just javascript, then refactored the whole site in order to try and apply some CSS tools.</p>
