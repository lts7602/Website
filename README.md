Website practice
This website is to practice using html and javasxript. This is my first time using either language. 
The website serves as a way to display my resume and some of the skills I've learned this summer. It is never finished and will likely recieve changes from time to time.
The next part of my project will be commenting lines of code to be more accessible to readers.
